    "# Dissatisfied or Just Moving On — Analyzing Exit Surveys in Australia.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the exit surveys of two organizations, [the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE)](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey) and the [Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) in Queensland, Australia will be analyzed. The data from both surveys will be cleaned for analysis individually and combined to determine if employees are leaving due to dissatisfaction with the job or if they simply leaving of their own accord. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the project is to answer two questions presented by the stakeholders: \n",
    "- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing the analysis for the datasets, the conclusions that were drawn were that individuals with 7 or more years of employment were more likely to leave due to disatisfaction of some sort with their job. This was seen throughout and irregardless of the company or combined. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more details, please refer to the full analysis below. "

    "In this project, we cleaned and analyzed two exit surveys from DETE and TAFE individually and combined to assess which employees were resigning due to dissatisfaction based on years of service. The conclusion that was drawn was that employees with 7 or more years of experience were more likely to resign due to dissatisfaction than their younger counterparts. This was displayed between the three plots as all three were almost all alike, with the only difference between the plots being the values displayed. DETE had a higher percentage of employees resigning compared to TAFE with the combined plot falling between them which makes sense as it is in essence a middle ground between both plots. The most likely reason for DETE having a higher percentage is that it had almost double the amount of dissatisfied employees than TAFE did."
